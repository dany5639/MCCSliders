# MCCSliders
*OUTDATED: DOES NOT WORK WITH THE LATEST MCC VERSION*

For use only with Halo Reach MCC (EAC disabled) on PC to move the first person weapons view models.

Thank to Camden for the Zeta tool that allowed me to generate the presets (txt file)
Thanks to Zedd and those who worked on Assembly for the code to find tags in memory.
